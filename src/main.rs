//! # Document Deduplication CLI
//!
//! Command-line interface for exact and fuzzy (MinHash) document deduplication.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This tool supports four deduplication strategies:
//!
//! | Method | Storage | Best For |
//! |--------|---------|----------|
//! | Exact + Memory | In-memory | Small datasets, simple exact matching |
//! | Exact + Disk | Disk-based | Large datasets, exact matching, distributed |
//! | MinHash + Memory | In-memory | Small datasets, fuzzy matching |
//! | MinHash + Disk | Disk-based | Large datasets, fuzzy matching, distributed |
//!
//! ## Exact vs. Fuzzy Deduplication
//!
//! - **Exact**: Removes documents with identical content (or identical hash keys).
//!   Fast and deterministic, but misses near-duplicates.
//!
//! - **Fuzzy (MinHash)**: Uses locality-sensitive hashing to find near-duplicates
//!   based on Jaccard similarity. Follows the algorithm from
//!   [Lee et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06499).
//!
//! ## Memory vs. Disk
//!
//! - **Memory**: Stores intermediate data structures in RAM. Simpler to use,
//!   no setup required, but limited by available memory.
//!
//! - **Disk**: Stores intermediate files on disk. Supports datasets that don't
//!   fit in memory and enables distributed processing across multiple machines.
//!
//! ## Quick Start Examples
//!
//! ### Exact Deduplication (Small Dataset)
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release -- exact-dedup-memory \
//!   --input-dir /data/docs \
//!   --output-dir /data/deduped \
//!   --text-key "content"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Fuzzy Deduplication (Small Dataset)
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release -- minhash-memory \
//!   --input-dir /data/docs \
//!   --storage-dir /tmp/work \
//!   --output-dir /data/deduped \
//!   --text-key "text" \
//!   --num-buckets 20 \
//!   --bucket-size 5
//! ```
//!
//! ### Fuzzy Deduplication (Large Dataset, Distributed)
//! ```bash
//! # Step 1: Build file map (run once)
//! cargo run --release -- mh-build-file-map \
//!   --input-dir /data/docs \
//!   --storage-dir /shared/work
//!
//! # Step 2: Hash documents (run on multiple workers with different path-chunk values)
//! cargo run --release -- mh-hash-docs \
//!   --local-input /data/docs \
//!   --storage-dir /shared/work \
//!   --text-key "text" \
//!   --path-chunk 0 \
//!   --num-path-chunks 10
//!
//! # Step 3: Gather edges (run once, requires all signatures)
//! cargo run --release -- mh-gather-edges \
//!   --storage-dir /shared/work
//!
//! # Step 4: Build union-find (run once on single machine)
//! cargo run --release -- mh-build-uf \
//!   --storage-dir /shared/work \
//!   --num-path-chunks 10
//!
//! # Step 5: Clean files (run on multiple workers with different path-chunk values)
//! cargo run --release -- mh-clean-files \
//!   --input-dir /data/docs \
//!   --storage-dir /shared/work \
//!   --output-dir /data/deduped \
//!   --path-chunk 0 \
//!   --num-path-chunks 10 \
//!   --remove-duplicates true
//! ```

/* 4 basic use cases here:
{Exact, Fuzzy} x {Memory, Disk} deduplication:

Exact vs Fuzzy(minhash) Deduplication:
- Exact deduplication only keeps _one_ copy of a particular document, according to an either prespecified
  identifying field (i.e. a hash of the text), or will hash the text itself.
- Fuzzy deduplication using minhash performs minhash according to this schema: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06499
  More details on how this works in minhash.rs

Memory or Disk-based settings:
- In the memory-based settings, the necessary intermediate data structures are stored in memory. This use case
  is good for when the dataset you're deduplicating is relatively small. This should be plug-n-play and does not
  require careful system setup.
- In the disk-based setting: the intermediate data structures are stored on disk. This is useful for when the
  dataset is large and distributed processing is needed. See the README/tutorials for these large-scale jobs.

/*
New plan:
It helps to consider minHash in phases:

Phase 1: Look at all the file paths we want to run minHash dedup on and rename them
         with usize identifiers. Store this in a FileMap structure.
         In this way, all documents are now uniquely identified by their
         (path_id, line_num)

Phase 2: Compute (band_id, signature, doc_id) for every document.
         This is the heavy minhashing step, but can be parallelized
         across chunks over the paths.

         Essentially this works as follows -- for each path
         we loop over documents and compute it's minhash signatures.
         We compute band_size * num_bands signatures, and then hash
         the signature across each band (rows in the pic below).
         If any two documents share the same (band_id, siganture), then
         they are duplicates.

                        Band Size
             ----------------------------
            |                            |
            |                            |
      Bands |                            |
            |                            |
            |                            |
            ------------------------------


Phase 3: Collect edges, linking all the documents that share the same
         (band_id, siganture) together. Store these in a separate set of files.

Phase 4: Combine all the edges and build a GLOBAL union find data structure and
         use this to collect connected components. Store both these connected
         components (for later examination), and collect the lines that should
         be removed from the dataset (grouped by path_chunk, so they can be pruned
         in a multinode setting)

Phase 5: Clean the duplicate documents from the paths. Phase 4 tells us which
         lines of each path should be removed.


(
Auxiliary phase: For examination purposes, we can look at each connected component
                  and get stats on the true pairwise jaccard similarity between
                  documents marked as "duplicates"
)

----------------
Some design notes:

+ Config: This can be done without a config, but your

+ Disk space: We rely heavily on storing auxiliary data structures on disk.
              Basically there's a state change after every phase where we make
              some new files after every phase. I'll build some python code
              to read these for debuggy purposes later (TBD). Each section
              will describe the file structure and contents in comments below.

+ Parallelism: Phase 3 and phase 4 need to be done globally (unfortunately,
               there's no avoiding at least one global step). Phase 1 only
               really needs access to the filenames but is very cheap.
               Phase 2, 4, and 5 are the heavy steps and can be done across
               file parallelism. This would require some coordination with the
               global data structures generated by phase 3 and 4.

+ s3: We don't touch s3 in rust. I have yet to find a package that works
      reliably, so let's just assume that all interaction between the LFS
      and s3 is done outside the context of this rust code


+ Input path structure: For simplicity, we require that the input paths all
                        live in one directory and have unique basenames.


+ One fell swoop: if your dataset is small enough that you just want to do
                  all phases in one command, use `min-hash`
